**SUMMARY** 
<br />
<br />The Nursery Environment Project creates an atmosphere for the plants to grow in cold climatic conditions. It allows people living at hill stations where the temperature remains
negative most of the time to grow plants easily. Moreover, it will light the room when the outside weather becomes dark.
<br />

**SPECIFICATIONS** 
1) Pin connections for the thermistor and the LED’s has been initialized by declaring the integer values. <br /> 
2) The input pins and the output pins are set in the void setup. <br />
3) In the void loop, if-conditions are set for the thermistor to detect the temperature less than or equal to 80° F. If it is greater than that, then the relay would stop working.
4) Next, the if-conditions are set for the photoresistor to detect the light intensity less than 150. If it gets less than that, then the LED’s automatically start lighting.
